/*Exercise 1 : Information
Instructions
Part I : function with no parameters
Create a function called infoAboutMe() that takes no parameter.
The function should console.log a sentence about you (ie. your name, age, hobbies ect…).
Call the function.


Part II : function with three parameters
Create a function called infoAboutPerson(personName, personAge, personFavoriteColor) that takes 3 parameters.
The function should console.log a sentence about the person (ie. “You name is …, you are .. years old, your favorite color is …”)
Call the function twice with the following arguments:
infoAboutPerson("David", 45, "blue")
infoAboutPerson("Josh", 12, "yellow")
*/
// Part I : function with no parameters
function infoAboutMe(){
    console.log("I am 400 years old,etc")
}
infoAboutMe()
// Part II : function with three parameters
function infoAboutPerson(personName, personAge, personFavoriteColor){
    console.log(`Your name is ${personName}, your age is ${personAge}, your favorite color is ${personFavoriteColor}`);
}
infoAboutPerson("David", 45, "blue")
infoAboutPerson("Josh", 12, "yellow")

/*Exercise 2 : Tips
Instructions
John created a simple tip calculator to help calculate how much to tip when he and his family go to restaurants.
Create a function named calculateTip() that takes no parameter.
Inside the function, ask John for the amount of the bill.
Here are the rules
If the bill is less than $50, tip 20%.
If the bill is between $50 and $200, tip 15%.
If the bill is more than $200, tip 10%.
Console.log the tip amount and the final bill (bill + tip).
Call the calculateTip() function.
*/
function calculateTip(){
    let billAmount = parseInt(prompt("Insert amount of the bill"))
    let tipAmount = 0
    if (billAmount < 50){
        tipAmount = billAmount*0.2;
    }else if(billAmount > 50 && billAmount < 200){ 
        tipAmount= billAmount*0.15;
    }else{
        tipAmount = billAmount*0.1;
    }
    console.log(`the tip amount is: ${tipAmount}, the total amount is ${tipAmount+billAmount}`)
}
calculateTip()


/*Exercise 3 : Find The Numbers Divisible By 23
Instructions
Create a function call isDivisible() that takes no parameter.
In the function, loop through numbers 0 to 500.
Console.log all the numbers divisible by 23.
At the end, console.log the sum of all numbers that are divisible by 23.
Outcome : 0 23 46 69 92 115 138 161 184 207 230 253 276 299 322 345 368
391 414 437 460 483
Sum : 5313
Bonus: Add a parameter divisor to the function.

isDivisible(divisor)

Example:
isDivisible(3) : Console.log all the numbers divisible by 3, and their sum
isDivisible(45) : Console.log all the numbers divisible by 45, and their sum
*/

function isDivisible() {
    for (let n = 0; n <= 500; n++){
        let divider = (n/23) == 0
        console.log(divider)

        }
    }
isDivisible();

/*Exercise 4 : Shopping List
Instructions
Add the stock and prices objects to your js file.
Create an array called shoppingList with the following items: “banana”, “orange”, and “apple”. It means that you have 1 banana, 1 orange and 1 apple in your cart.
Create a function called myBill() that takes no parameters.
The function should return the total price of your shoppingList. In order to do this you must follow these rules:
The item must be in stock.
If the item is in stock find out the price in the prices object.
Call the myBill() function.
Bonus: If the item is in stock, decrease the item’s stock by 1
*/

// let stock = { 
//     "banana": 6, 
//     "apple": 0,
//     "pear": 12,
//     "orange": 32,
//     "blueberry":1
// }  

// let prices = {    
//     "banana": 4, 
//     "apple": 2, 
//     "pear": 1,
//     "orange": 1.5,
//     "blueberry":10
// } 

// let shoppingList = ["banana", "orange", "apple"]

// function mybill(){
    
// }

// Exercise 5 : What’s In My Wallet ?
// Instructions
// Note: Read the illustration (point 4), while reading the instructions

// Create a function named changeEnough(itemPrice, amountOfChange) that receives two arguments :
// an item price
// and an array representing the amount of change in your pocket.

// In the function, determine whether or not you can afford the item.
// If the sum of the change is bigger or equal than the item’s price (ie. it means that you can afford the item), the function should return true
// If the sum of the change is smaller than the item’s price (ie. it means that you cannot afford the item) the function should return false

// Change will always be represented in the following order: quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies.
// A quarters is 0.25
// A dimes is 0.10
// A nickel is 0.05
// A penny is 0.01


// 4. To illustrate:

// After you created the function, invoke it like this:

// changeEnough(4.25, [25, 20, 5, 0])
// The value 4.25 represents the item’s price
// The array [25, 20, 5, 0] represents 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies.
// The function should return true, since having 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies gives you 6.25 + 2 + .25 + 0 = 8.50 which is bigger than 4.25 (the total amount due)


// Examples

// changeEnough(14.11, [2,100,0,0]) => returns false
// changeEnough(0.75, [0,0,20,5]) => returns true

// const detailMoney = [0.25, 0.10, 0.05, 0.01]
// function changeEnough (itemPrice, amountOfChange){
//     for (i=0; i<amountOfChange.length; i++){
//         // console.log("money is :", amountOfChange[i])
//         // console.log("worth is :", detailsMoney[i])
//         let moneyWorth = amountOfChange[i]*detailMoney[i]
//         sumMoney += moneyWorth

//         if (sumMoney >= itemPrice){
//             return true;
//         } else {
//             return false;
//         }
        

//     }
// }
// function cashier(productPrice, moneyWaller)

// Exercise 6 : Vacations Costs
// Instructions
// Let’s create functions that calculate your vacation’s costs:

// Define a function called hotelCost().
// It should ask the user for the number of nights they would like to stay in the hotel.
// If the user doesn’t answer or if the answer is not a number, ask again.
// The hotel costs $140 per night. The function should return the total price of the hotel.

// Define a function called planeRideCost().
// It should ask the user for their destination.
// If the user doesn’t answer or if the answer is not a string, ask again.
// The function should return a different price depending on the location.
// “London”: 183$
// “Paris” : 220$
// All other destination : 300$

// Define a function called rentalCarCost().
// It should ask the user for the number of days they would like to rent the car.
// If the user doesn’t answer or if the answer is not a number, ask again.
// Calculate the cost to rent the car. The car costs $40 everyday.
// If the user rents a car for more than 10 days, they get a 5% discount.
// The function should return the total price of the car rental.

// Define a function called totalVacationCost() that returns the total cost of the user’s vacation by calling the 3 functions that you created above.
// Example : The car cost: $x, the hotel cost: $y, the plane tickets cost: $z.
// Hint: You have to call the functions hotelCost(), planeRideCost() and rentalCarCost() inside the function totalVacationCost().

// Call the function totalVacationCost()

// Bonus: Instead of using a prompt inside the 3 first functions, only use a prompt inside the totalVacationCost() function. You need to change the 3 first functions, accordingly.
